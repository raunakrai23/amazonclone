This Amazon clone website is made using HTML and CSS! ðŸ›’ðŸŒŸ 

->In this project, I utilized HTML to create a comprehensive e-commerce website. I made sure to include all the necessary page layout tags and properties, forms, lists ,etc to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.

->I dived deep into all the essential CSS properties, including the box model, fonts and display ,CSS Flexbox and CSS grid.
 But thatâ€™s not allâ€”I also applied search engine optimization (SEO) techniques like favicons, meta tags, and internal linking for better discoverability.

-> Also used "font awesome cdn" to import several icons like cart, search icon,etc. to this project.
 
The result? A sleek, functional e-commerce site that mirrors the Amazon experience.
